I went to my first Girl Develop It (GDI) Meetup and survived! Before having gone, I really enjoyed the theory behind meetups, just didn't know if it would be of benefit to me, but it really was. Got to see other programmers and see where on my journey I was in relation to them. It's hard to be objective about your web-development journey when you're learning by yourself online -- so  these meetups are essential.

We had a presentation with Lisa Seacat from IBM, who spoke about Apache Cordova and how they use it for quick deployment in mobile. I haven't dipped my toes in mobile yet, but it was fun to do it in a group of supportive peers.
