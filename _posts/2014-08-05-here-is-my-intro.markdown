I started 2014 with my definite resolution to commit to coding/web development. I relate a lot to the commands that are used in the Terminal -- I even want to use it as inspiration sometimes. I will commit. I will -sass watch over my self.  

I started the new year with classes in HTML/CSS/JavaScript over at [Skillcrush](www.skillcrush.com). I tried keeping up and loved the social aspect of it. It seemed as if there was always someone in the chat or the message boards, but I fell behind but signed up for their Web Developer course that also taught some Ruby and became familiar using the command line. 

I became more confident in my skills and in July started [Treehouse](www.teamtreehouse.com).  I like the points structure and how in-depth each course goes and even though I clawed my eyes out through the gradient section of the CSS Deep Dive but in the end it made me stronger or at least I like to tell myself that. My current favorite teacher is Jim Hoskins, I liked the way he taught JavaScript and it even made sense to me the second time around. I'm almost done with my track and I want to keep getting stronger in my skills.

My goals are to start shipping projects and making websites for my friends & family who own side businesses. We all have side-hustles, I'm ready to have some fun.
